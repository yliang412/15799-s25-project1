# Reflection

In the root of your submission, please include a file reflection.md that describes:

- What you tried -- we will take effort into account when assigning final grades
- What worked
- (Optional) Feedback on this project (complexity, difficulty, duration, suggestions for future iterations)
You do not need to write much, bullet points are fine.
